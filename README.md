Crow Wing County GIS API for Python... or something
===

I'm just doing this to help my dad and brother at work. Ignore.


How to use
===

For Cass County, do stuff manually. Sucks, right?

  * Download raw CSV
  * Run process.py

For Crow Wing, use gis.py
For Aitkin County, use gis_aitkin.py

Once you've got all the data you want, run csv-gather.py

Ship that resulting CSV off to your friendly neighborhood label printer?
